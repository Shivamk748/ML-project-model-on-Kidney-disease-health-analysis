# ML-project-model-on-Kidney-disease-health-analysis
Project Overview
This project applies machine learning to analyze and classify health data, focusing on indicators of kidney health. The goal is to identify key features associated with kidney disease and predict health outcomes based on available health metrics.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project, kidney_disease.csv, contains various health metrics potentially indicative of kidney health status, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, blood urea, and more. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of kidney disease.

Key Features
Age: Patientâ€™s age
Blood Pressure: Blood pressure levels
Blood Glucose Random: Random blood glucose levels
Blood Urea: Urea level in the blood
Serum Creatinine: Creatinine level in the serum
Sodium and Potassium: Electrolyte levels
Haemoglobin: Hemoglobin level in blood
Other relevant  results and categorical indicators of health status.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the utility of machine learning in predicting kidney health status from health metrics, which can help in early disease detection and intervention.
